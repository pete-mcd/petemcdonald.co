In January 2003, the Minister for Rural Affairs, Jim Sutton, set up the Land Access Ministerial Reference Group to examine access to land. In August 2003 the Government published the Group's report, Walking Access in the New Zealand Outdoors. Accompanying each copy of the Report was a letter from Jim Sutton inviting public comment. The letter included a list of questions under the heading, 'Feedback'. 'High-quality Access' responded to those feedback questions.

‘The best submission we’ve received, out of over a thousand.’ Mark Neeson. This submission was credited with having provided the Purpose clause for Part 1 of the Walking Access Act 2008.
